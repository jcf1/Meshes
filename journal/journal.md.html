================================================
Did svn checkout of 1-meshes lab.
Wrote Draft of Report in 45 minutes.
I tried to create a cube using the .off fiel type but could only make triangles insted of squares like I wanted:
![bad cube](cube-error.jpg)
Moved onto makeCylinder.  wrote the MVP for makeCylinder, but I'm only getting some of my triangels to actually show up on the sides of my cylinder.
Created the functions 'makeHeightfield' and 'makeGlass'.  Need to fix it with guiPane since they are manly just the starter code added.

================================================
I was gone for the weekend, so this is the first time I ahve been able to work on graphics since Lab.
Fixed my cube.off since I didn't realise that the order in which we list the veritices to create a face affected how the program would try to render the face, so once I paid attention to how I was listing the vertices that made up the faces, it worked.
Fixed my makeCylinder once again by paying attention to how I was listing the vertices.  I also wasn't multiplying my x and z values on the circles by radius.  Finally, I fixed some math errors where I had things like ((i + 1 + vertices) % verticies*2) rather than (((i+1) % verticies) + verticies).
Extended my makeCylinder to include height and radius parameters.
Added a GUI called makeCylinder that allows a user to generate a cylinder with a given height and radius.  changed name of original make cylinder to createCylinder.
Made an attempt at makeHeightfield, but it seems to be displaying upside down.
Fixed makeHeightfield to not display upside down.  I was getting the right-hand rule mixed up, and  was able to fix it by changing some variables in my call to write the faces of the heightfield.
Heightfield is now cutting off on some rectangular images and seems to be looping around since I can see part of it from below.
Needed to switch how I was iterating through image height and width in order to make heightfield to stop looping around the bottom of itself.
Finished makeHeightfield.
Had a few problems with makeGlass, like creting the inside instead of the outside of the glass, but other wise very smooth sailing.

Finished makeGlass.
